 shahzeb:  Hey Nikhil!
Hi, thanks for staying on
 me:  Hello :)
How are you :)
 shahzeb:  :) am fine, thanks!
 me:  okay so you want to make a social networking site
in google app engine
Do you have any timelines fixed screenshot
and functionality prepared
 shahzeb:  ok... one thing at a time
1) Yes,
a S Networking site
what is Timelines Fixed Screenshot?
Functionality is same as standard
'add, comment, like, attach, post'
 me:  Screenshot means whatever functionality you want let say login app
How the login page should look like
? etc
 shahzeb:  doesnt matter the look
as long as it's there
for now, whatever is easiest, even if it's all just one below the other
 me:  okay
Now timeline means when you want things get done
?
i can start from 28 feb 2012
 shahzeb:  how much time would you need for say the basic set up
oh...
i was hoping for milestone 1 by then
how i understand django is that there are templates out there
which can be customised
 me:  Can i ask you one question ?
 shahzeb:  and there must be one for S Networking, right>
sure!
 me:  why are not making it in django ?
Is it a specific requirement ?
for Google App engine
 Sent at 12:47 AM on Tuesday
 shahzeb:  uhm
 me:  why we are not making this app in django thats my question is ?
 shahzeb:  actually, i want it in django
 me:  even i am more comfortable in django
 shahzeb:  oh totally!
i am totally for django
 me:  So correct me if i am wrong
we want this Social network app
in django
there is no google app engine
right ?
 shahzeb:  one sec
why can't we have a django project on GAE?
we write it using django and upload it in GAE?
 me:  Integration of GAE is not much
google groups is working on that
 shahzeb:  GAE has a python SDK
 me:  they have done for some of the app
but not much
yes it has a python sdk
 shahzeb:  so 1) u write it in django 2) upload it to GAE
 me:  okay what i will do is
I start building this app
in django and then when we
are done
we will integrate to GAE
do we both agree on this ?
 shahzeb:  have u ever integrated a Django project to GAE?
 me:  frankly speaking NO but want to
intergrate to GAE
 shahzeb:  ok... coz, i;ve tried simple templates... but not a S Networking
and it's pretty simple
 me:  okay that sounds great
 shahzeb:  cool!
 me:  so you believe integration is not much tak
 shahzeb:  now let's talk money
 me:  task*
 shahzeb:  absolutely not
 me:  okay

completed

functionality in django
Can you tell me the version ?
in which version you want to build
the latest stable release is 1.3.1
 shahzeb:  2.5 python
 me:  well thats python
 shahzeb:  so if i understand it correctly, the django version will not affect the python support level at 2.5, right?
